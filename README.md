This project was created as my application for a position with Touch Bistro

## Initialisation

Download this repo, it contains both the Express Back-End as 'api' and the React Front-End as 'frontend'.

Front-End built with `npx express-generator api` and Back-End built with `npx create-react-app frontend`.

cd into frontend directory and npm install, then cd into the api directory and do the same.

```
cd frontend
npm install
cd ../api
npm install

```

Once complete run `npm start`, this will start both the frontend and api on localhost:3000 and localhost:9000.

##### From here the Median Prime Finder will be running.

## Testing

To run Front-End test, once the server is running cd into the frontend directory and run `npm test`.

To run Back-End test, cd into api and run `npm test`.
